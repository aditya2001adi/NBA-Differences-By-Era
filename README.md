# NBA-Differences-By-Era
This is my first full-length data analysis project ever in Python. With most of my past work in R, this project was a great way for me to get exposure to Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

By scraping NBA data from basketball-reference.com, I was able to gather data from 2022 and 1996 and compare the two years (and, by extension, the two eras) of basketball to find any insights into how the game has changed over the past few decades. For a more in depth understanding of the study, head over to the .ipynb, which explains the project in full detail!
